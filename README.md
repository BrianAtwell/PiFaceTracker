# PiFaceTracker
Track a person face with OpenCV and a PID controller

## Description
This project was originally setup to use raspberry pi camera with a pan/tilt and some servos to track a person's face. A half of a ping pong ball is glued to the camera as an eyeball for a halloween prop. The idea was originally posted in Maker magizine for a cat tracker and there are other projects with the same concept.

In this project I also enabled controll of the pan/tilt of the camera through an Xbox 360 controller.

## Purpose
I wanted to learn more about OpenCV and develop my own PID controller. I wanted to make my own PID controller so I could understand more about for work. Using a PID controller for a couple of servos is low cost and low risk compared to other scenarios.
